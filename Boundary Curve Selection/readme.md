# Boundary Curve Selection

This definition makes the boundary curve in regions by defining region points.
Not the best solution but the easiest one. I used this for making curve in Cad  details for Honeybee THERM simulations since it made the job much much easier.
Just place points in the regions you want to make the boundary curve for simulation and import those points in the grasshopper.
